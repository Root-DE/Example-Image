# Example-Image
This repository is used to demonstrate the SLSA implementation. On the tag v0.1.19 you can see how the provenance is created, signed, written to the transparency logs and verified in the [actions](https://github.com/Root-DE/Example-Image/runs/7467154335?check_suite_focus=true). The tag v0.1.19 is based on a [modified SLSA logic](https://github.com/jobroe10/slsa-github-generator), because at that time the official SLSA implementation was faulty, but in the meantime this has been corrected, so that with the tag v0.1.21 it was possible to switch to this.

More information can be found in the main repository: [Applied Cybersecurity Django](https://github.com/Root-DE/Applied-Cybersecurity-Django).
